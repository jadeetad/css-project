  <p> <i> The Vaseline® brand was built on the healing efficacy of Vaseline® Jelly.
     Formulated in 1870, this “Wonder Jelly” has been healing dry skin for over 150 years. </p>   

<p>Today, what started with a jar of Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly has grown into an expansive product,<br>
 portfolio that includes Vaseline® Intensive Care™ Lotions and Vaseline® Lip Therapy™.</p> <br>
 <p>However, the restorative power of Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly can still be found inside the products that Vaseline® makes.<br>
  We invite you to go back in time and learn the origins of the Vaseline® brand,<br>
   and how after a century of restoring skin it became one of the most celebrated skin care brands around the world.</i></p>
